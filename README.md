# guessmynumber
Guess My Number is a simple game built using HTML, CSS and JS. The game is played between a computer and a player, where the player has to guess a number that the computer has chosen.

The game starts with the computer choosing a random number between 1 and 20. The player is then prompted to guess the number. If the player's guess is higher than the computer's number, the computer will prompt the player to guess a lower number. Similarly, if the player's guess is lower than the computer's number, the computer will prompt the player to guess a higher number. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.

The game has been built using JS's random library to generate a random number, and the input function to take the player's guess as input.
